# Forcing a 4.x version of traitlets. nbconvert requests `traitlets>=4.2` which allows newer 5.x
# releases. At the time of this writing, the traitlets project in GitHub has no release tag or
# release notes for 5.0.0. There is even a report of a potential problem with nbconvert:
# https://github.com/ipython/traitlets/issues/609. Therefore, it is safest to use a known working
# version of traitlets.
traitlets==4.3.3
